# Nike-Snkrs-Bot
This is an application which user can buy nike snkrs release sneakers.

# Requirements
- Accounts which you want to use with this application need saved credit card and address. Prepare your accounts like that. In turkey it is impossible to save credit card without trying one release manually. Consider those.
- According to above statement, code needs account mail, password, CVC, link of the product and shoe_size. They are barried to code right now. Maybe i updated later on.

# Prediction
- Probably if i try to buy a single product with different 20 account in one ip address, nike will block me.

# Observation
- In first 30-40 sec. when i try to buy an sneakers, in the line i get error like "An error occured". Maybe it is not good idea to buy in first 30-40 sec.

# Goals
- Read csv for taking neccessary informations.
- Maybe add proxy?

# Results
- Now it works for 2 account. Lets try with 20 next time without proxy trying.
