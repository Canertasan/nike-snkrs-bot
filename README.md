# nike-snkrs-bot
This is an application which user can buy nike snkrs release sneakers.

# Prediction
- Probably if i try to buy a single product with different 20 account in one ip address, nike will block me.

# Observation
- In first 30-40 sec. when i try to buy an sneakers, in the line i get error like "An error occured". Maybe it is not good idea to buy in first 30-40 sec.

# Goals
- Read csv for taking neccessary informations.
- Maybe add proxy?

# Results
- Now it works for 2 account. Lets try with 20 next time without proxy trying.
